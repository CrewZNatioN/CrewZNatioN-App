The trajectory details the arduous journey of an AI engineer guiding a user to set up and run an Expo mobile application called CrewZNatioN on their local Mac, with significant focus on troubleshooting user-side environmental and command execution issues. The initial goal was to build an automotive social media app from 0 to 1, then deploy it. Key challenges included the user's difficulty with Terminal commands, file creation/naming, incorrect file formats (RTF instead of plain text), Node.js and npm permission errors, and persistent Apple 2FA issues during EAS build attempts. The AI demonstrated significant patience and adaptability, repeatedly simplifying instructions, providing alternative methods (like  commands instead of file copies), and systematically troubleshooting OS-level problems. Ultimately, a fully functional local development environment was established, the UI was built and refined, and the app was successfully launched and previewed on the user's iPhone, though logo scaling remains a minor issue.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was diligently working with the user to finalize the UI/UX branding of the CrewZNatioN application. The core application structure and screens (welcome, login, register, tab navigation, feed, profile, garage) have been built and are functional on the user's iPhone via Expo Go.

The precise work involved:
1.  **Refining Logo Placement:** The user explicitly requested to switch the welcome screen logo to the *first* provided logo () and use the *second* provided logo () on the login screen, positioned above Welcome Back.
2.  **Color Branding:** Adjusting the app's accent colors, particularly on the login screen, to better match the gold/black branding of the  logo (using ).
3.  **Logo Scaling:** The user reported that the login screen logo was still very small despite previous adjustments. The AI responded by making the  significantly larger:
    
This change was applied to .

The user reported that  to refresh the app after this latest logo size adjustment. This indicates a potential issue with the Expo development server's responsiveness or the app's ability to hot-reload changes.
